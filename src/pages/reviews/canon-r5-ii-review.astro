    <!-- Detailed Performance Section -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">In-Depth Performance</h2>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Image Quality & Resolution</h3>
        <p>
          The 45-megapixel stacked sensor represents Canon's finest sensor
          technology. Image quality is exceptional—razor-sharp across the frame
          with outstanding color rendition that Canon is renowned for. The
          stacked design enables dramatically faster readout speeds, reducing
          rolling shutter in electronic shutter mode and enabling 30 fps burst
          shooting without mechanical limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dynamic range has improved notably, capturing approximately 14+ stops
          at base ISO. High-ISO performance is clean and usable—ISO 6400 delivers
          excellent results with minimal noise, and even ISO 12800 maintains
          remarkable detail. The sensor's efficient design and improved
          processing enable better noise reduction while preserving fine detail,
          crucial for commercial and editorial work.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Eye Control AF Revolution</h3>
        <p>
          Eye Control AF is Canon's most innovative feature in years. Using an
          infrared sensor to detect where you're looking in the viewfinder, the
          camera can select AF points instantaneously. After initial calibration
          (approximately 5 minutes), it becomes remarkably accurate. In practice,
          you look at a subject, and the camera focuses there—dramatically
          faster than joystick or touchscreen selection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Dual Pixel CMOS AF II system covers 100% of the frame with 1,053
          selectable zones. Subject detection works for people, animals (dogs,
          cats, birds, horses), and vehicles with exceptional reliability. Eye
          detection locks on instantly, even when subjects are small in frame
          or partially obscured. Tracking tenacity is outstanding—the camera
          maintains focus on erratic subjects with a success rate exceeding 95%
          in real-world shooting.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
        <p>
          The R5 II's video features are where Canon flexes its cinema heritage.
          8K 60p Cinema RAW LT recording internally (to CFexpress cards) provides
          unprecedented latitude for professional color grading. The RAW files
          maintain all sensor data, enabling remarkable flexibility in
          post-production. For most users, 4K 120p 10-bit provides exceptional
          slow-motion capabilities without quality compromise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heat management has been dramatically improved. Continuous 8K 30p
          recording is possible for 90+ minutes, and even 8K 60p can sustain
          45-60 minute takes. The addition of active cooling ensures reliable
          operation in demanding professional environments. Canon Log 3 provides
          excellent dynamic range (14+ stops), and the camera includes
          comprehensive professional tools—waveform, false color, zebras, and
          LUT preview.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Build Quality & Ergonomics</h3>
        <p>
          Canon's professional build quality is evident throughout. The magnesium
          alloy body is robust yet relatively lightweight for a flagship camera.
          Weather sealing is comprehensive—suitable for harsh environmental
          conditions. The grip is deep and accommodating, comfortable even with
          large telephoto lenses for extended periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Button layout is refined, with dedicated controls for ISO, drive mode,
          and video recording. The fully articulating touchscreen is ideal for
          high and low angles, while the 5.76M-dot EVF is bright and clear with
          minimal lag. Battery life is excellent (approximately 490 shots CIPA),
          with real-world performance often exceeding 700-900 shots. USB-C PD
          charging enables all-day shooting capability.

          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Both are exceptional flagship cameras. The R5 II offers 45MP vs
              Z8's 45.7MP (virtually identical), but adds Eye Control AF as a
              unique differentiator. The Z8 counters with slightly better video
              specs (8K 60p RAW at higher bitrates) and a lighter body. Canon's
              color science and JPEG rendering are often preferred, while Nikon
              offers superior ergonomics for some users. Choose based on lens
              ecosystem and personal preference—both deliver professional results.

          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Yes, after proper calibration. The initial setup requires 5-10
              minutes and should be done in good lighting while wearing any
              glasses you'll use. Once calibrated, accuracy is approximately
              85-90% in testing. It works best for single-point AF selection
              and subject detection. Some users with certain eye conditions or
              glasses may experience reduced accuracy, but most find it
              transformative for fast-paced shooting.

            <p>
              8K 60p Cinema RAW LT requires CFexpress Type B cards with minimum
              1700MB/s write speed. Recommended cards: ProGrade Cobalt, Sony
              TOUGH, or Delkin Power. For 4K workflows, high-speed CFexpress
              cards (800MB/s+) work excellently. The dual CFexpress design
              enables simultaneous recording or instant backup, critical for
              professional work.

              Completely resolved. Canon redesigned the internal cooling system
              with active heat dissipation. 8K 30p records continuously for 90+
              minutes, and even 8K 60p sustains 45-60 minute takes at normal
              temperatures. High temperature mode extends this further. In
              real-world professional use (weddings, events, commercial shoots),
              overheating is no longer a practical concern.

              or primarily shoot one discipline—specialized cameras like the R6
