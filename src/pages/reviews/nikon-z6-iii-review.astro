          <h2 class="product-title">The Verdict</h2>
          <p>
            The Nikon Z6 III represents a significant evolution in Nikon's
            full-frame lineup. By combining a partially stacked sensor with
            advanced video features and improved autofocus, Nikon has created
            a camera that excels equally in photography and videography without
            compromise.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the camera for hybrid shooters who refuse to choose between
            stills and video. Whether you're covering weddings, shooting
            documentaries, or creating content for clients, the Z6 III provides
            professional results with exceptional ergonomics and reliability.

    <!-- Detailed Performance Section -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">In-Depth Performance</h2>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Image Quality & Sensor Performance</h3>
        <p>
          The 24-megapixel partially stacked sensor is a sweet spot for hybrid
          shooting. While not as high-resolution as the Z8 or Z9, it delivers
          exceptional image quality with larger pixels that excel in low light.
          The sensor's partial stacking enables improved readout speeds, reducing
          rolling shutter and enabling faster burst rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dynamic range is outstanding, capturing approximately 14 stops at base
          ISO. High-ISO performance is particularly impressive—ISO 6400 delivers
          clean, usable images, and even ISO 12800 maintains excellent detail
          with minimal noise reduction needed. This makes the Z6 III ideal for
          wedding photographers, event coverage, and available-light work.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Autofocus Revolution</h3>
        <p>
          Nikon has made massive strides in autofocus with the Z6 III. The
          493-point hybrid AF system now includes deep learning-based subject
          detection for 9 subject types: people, dogs, cats, birds, cars,
          motorcycles, bicycles, trains, and airplanes. Eye detection works
          reliably even when subjects are small in frame or partially obscured.
        </p>
        <p>
          3D-Tracking has been refined to stick to subjects with remarkable
          tenacity. In real-world testing, the camera maintained focus on erratic
          subjects (playing children, flying birds) with a success rate comparable
          to Sony's excellent system. Low-light AF performance is exceptional,
          working down to -9 EV—usable in near-dark conditions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
        <p>
          The Z6 III's video features are where Nikon flexes its hybrid muscles.
          Internal 6K 60p N-RAW recording (to CFexpress Type B cards) provides
          professional latitude for color grading. For most users, the 5.4K 60p
          oversampled 4K is exceptional—delivering sharp, detailed footage with
          excellent color science.
        </p>
        <p>
          4K 120p enables high-quality slow motion without sensor crop, a
          significant advantage over many competitors. The addition of internal
          ProRes 422 HQ gives editors maximum flexibility. Heat management is
          excellent—continuous 4K recording is possible for over 2 hours, and
          even 6K N-RAW can record for extended periods without overheating.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Ergonomics & Build</h3>
        <p>
          Nikon's ergonomics remain industry-leading. The Z6 III features a deep,
          sculpted grip that's comfortable even with large telephoto lenses. Button
          layout is logical, with dedicated ISO, drive mode, and video record
          buttons. The four-axis tilting touchscreen is a practical compromise—more
          versatile than fixed, yet more robust than fully articulating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Build quality is exceptional, with magnesium alloy construction and
          comprehensive weather sealing. The EN-EL15c battery provides excellent
          longevity—approximately 410 shots per charge (CIPA), with real-world
          performance often exceeding 600-800 shots. USB-C charging and power
          delivery enable all-day shooting when needed.

            How does the Z6 III compare to the Sony A7 IV?

          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              The Z6 III offers better video specs (6K vs 4K 60p), superior
              ergonomics, and longer battery life. The A7 IV counters with higher
              resolution (33MP vs 24MP) and wider native lens selection. Both have
              excellent autofocus, but Nikon's latest system is slightly more
              reliable in challenging conditions. Choose Z6 III for video-centric
              work, A7 IV if you need maximum resolution.
            </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">
            Is the Z6 III good for wildlife photography?
            <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Yes, very good but with caveats. The improved autofocus with bird
              detection is excellent, and 14fps is adequate for most situations.
              However, the 24MP resolution limits extreme cropping compared to
              higher-res cameras. It's ideal for wildlife video (4K 120p, 6K),
              and the buffer can handle long bursts. For resolution-critical work,
              consider the Z8.
            </p>
          </div>

            What memory cards work best with the Z6 III?

          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              For 6K N-RAW recording, you'll need CFexpress Type B cards with
              minimum 1400MB/s write speed (recommended: Sony TOUGH or ProGrade
              Cobalt). For 4K video and photography, high-speed UHS-II SD cards
              (V90 rated) work excellently. The dual-slot design allows CFexpress
              for video and SD for photo backup, optimizing workflow.
            </p>
          </div>

            Does the Z6 III overheat during extended video recording?

          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Heat management is excellent. In standard temperature mode, 4K 60p
              can record for 125+ minutes continuously. Even 6K N-RAW recording
              is possible for 40-50 minutes before thermal limits. The camera
              includes High Temperature settings that extend recording time further,
              though with slightly increased fan noise. Overheating is not a
              practical concern for most users.
