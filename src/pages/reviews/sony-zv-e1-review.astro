                    <p>
                        The Sony ZV-E1 is essentially an A7S III reimagined for creators. The same 12MP full-frame sensor delivers exceptional low-light performance and 4K120 slow motion. Add Sony's latest AI autofocus and you have the most capable vlog camera ever made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At $2,198, it's not cheap, but it's significantly less than an A7S III while adding creator-specific features like Product Showcase mode and the best built-in microphone on any camera.

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Low-Light Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    This is where the ZV-E1 dominates. The large, full-frame 12MP sensor collects massive amounts of light. ISO 25,600 looks clean enough for professional use. You can shoot in near darkness and get usable footage - something no APS-C camera can match.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For creators who film in dimly lit venues, restaurants, or at night, the ZV-E1 is transformative. Paired with a fast f/1.4 or f/1.8 lens, you rarely need artificial lighting.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>4K120 and Slow Motion</h3>
                <p>
                    Recording 4K at 120fps internally in 10-bit 4:2:2 is cinema-grade capability. Slow-motion B-roll elevates any video project. The quality is stunning - it's the same spec that A7S III shooters pay $3,500+ for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's a 1.1x crop at 4K120 and more visible rolling shutter than at lower framerates, but results are still excellent. For normal 4K60 or 4K30, the full sensor width is used.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Creator Features</h3>
                <p>
                    Sony built the ZV-E1 around creator workflows. Product Showcase mode detects when you hold up an object and smoothly shifts focus to it. Background Defocus creates blurred backgrounds with a button press. Cinematic Vlog mode adds film-like 2.35:1 framing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 3-capsule microphone is the best built-in audio Sony has ever made. It's genuinely usable for run-and-gun vlogging without external mics. Windscreen included.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Stabilization</h3>
                <p>
                    The 5-axis IBIS combined with Active Mode creates remarkably stable footage. It's not gimbal-level smooth, but for walking and talking videos, it's excellent. There's additional crop in Active Mode, but the stabilization is worth it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sony's software stabilization option (Catalyst) can further smooth footage in post without quality loss. Between IBIS and software, many creators find they don't need gimbals anymore.

                            For video, absolutely - 4K only needs 8MP. For photos, 12MP is limiting if you crop heavily or print large. This is a video-first camera. If stills are 50%+ of your work, consider the A7 IV instead.

                            Same sensor. The A7S III has a viewfinder, more professional body, and dual CFexpress slots. The ZV-E1 adds creator features, better built-in mic, and costs $1,000+ less. For vlogging and run-and-gun, ZV-E1 wins.

                        <p>
                            Sony improved heat management significantly. In 4K60 you can record for over an hour. 4K120 is more demanding - expect 30-40 minutes continuous in moderate temperatures. Good ventilation helps.

                <p>
                    The Sony ZV-E1 is the most capable vlog camera available. Full-frame, 4K120, legendary low-light, and Sony's best AI autofocus - it delivers on every front that matters for video creators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Buy it if:</strong> Video is your primary focus, you shoot in challenging light, and you want professional-grade capabilities without the A7S III's size and price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Skip it if:</strong> Photography is your priority (12MP is limiting), you prefer a viewfinder, or budget is constrained (the ZV-E10 II is excellent for less).
