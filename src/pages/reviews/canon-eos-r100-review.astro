                    <p>
                        The Canon EOS R100 is everything you need to start photography and nothing you don't. It uses Canon's proven 24.1MP sensor and delivers those beautiful Canon colors in every shot. No frills, no complexity - just solid fundamentals at the lowest price.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It makes sacrifices to hit this price point: no viewfinder, limited video specs, and no touchscreen. But if you're upgrading from a phone and want a real camera without breaking the bank, the R100 delivers.

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Image Quality & Sensor Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    The 24.1MP sensor delivers solid image quality with Canon's excellent color science. JPEGs look pleasing with accurate skin tones and well-saturated colors. 12 stops of dynamic range means you can recover shadows and highlights when needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ISO performance is usable up to ISO 3200 for clean images, with 6400 acceptable for web use. Beyond that, noise increases noticeably. For daytime and well-lit scenes, the R100 produces images that rival more expensive cameras.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Autofocus System</h3>
                <p>
                    Dual Pixel CMOS AF provides reliable focusing with 143 zones covering most of the frame. Face and Eye detection work well in good light, making portrait photography straightforward. The system is generation behind newer Canon cameras but capable for beginners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tracking moving subjects is where limitations show. Continuous AF at 3.5 fps is slow compared to the R50's 15 fps. For static subjects and casual shooting, it's perfectly adequate.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
                <p>
                    Video is the R100's weakest area. 4K is limited to 24fps with a 1.6x crop, making wide-angle shots difficult. 1080p60 is available for smoother motion. There's no log profile or advanced video features - what you see on screen is what you get.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For casual video clips and social media, it's acceptable. For serious video work or vlogging, spend more on the R50 or look at Sony's ZV-E10, which excels at video.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Ergonomics & Build</h3>
                <p>
                    The R100 is extremely light at 356g. It feels almost too light - like a toy camera - but build quality is adequate for careful use. The grip is minimal, so larger hands may find it cramped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fixed, non-touch screen is the most noticeable cost-cutting measure. You can't flip it for selfies or tilt it for low angles. Menu navigation is button-only. If these limitations matter to you, step up to the R50.

                        <p>
                            For controlled, daytime photography - yes. The larger sensor captures more light and detail. You get real optical blur and interchangeable lenses. But smartphones excel at computational photography, low-light, and convenience.

                        <p>
                            R50 if you can afford it. The viewfinder, touchscreen, and better video specs make it significantly more versatile. The R100 only makes sense if budget is the primary constraint.

                    The Canon EOS R100 is honest about what it is: an affordable entry point to mirrorless photography. It won't wow you with features, but it delivers Canon's legendary image quality at an accessible price.

                <p>
                    <strong>Buy it if:</strong> Budget is your primary concern, you prioritize stills over video, and you want Canon colors without Canon flagship prices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Skip it if:</strong> You need video capability, want a viewfinder, or can stretch to the R50 for a much better overall experience.
