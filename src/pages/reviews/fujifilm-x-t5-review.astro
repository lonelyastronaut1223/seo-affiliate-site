          <h2 class="product-title">The Verdict</h2>
          <p>
            The Fujifilm X-T5 is a love letter to photographers. It ditches the
            "hybrid" flip screen of the X-T4 for a photographer-friendly 3-way
            tilt screen and packs a massive <strong>40MP sensor</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            With dedicated dials for shutter speed, ISO, and exposure
            compensation, it's a joy to use. While the autofocus isn't quite at
            Sony's level for sports, the <strong>Film Simulations</strong> make your
            JPEGs look like finished art straight out of camera.
          </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">In-Depth Performance</h2>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>40MP Image Quality & Color Science</h3>
        <p>
          The 40.2-megapixel X-Trans CMOS 5 HR sensor delivers extraordinary detail—rivaling full-frame cameras in resolving power. The unique X-Trans color filter array eliminates moiré without an anti-aliasing filter, resulting in exceptional sharpness. Dynamic range measures approximately 13 stops at base ISO, providing significant latitude for shadow recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fujifilm's legendary color science shines. The 19 Film Simulations (including new Reala Ace and Nostalgic Neg) deliver stunning JPEG files straight out of camera—many professionals shoot JPEG exclusively. High-ISO performance is impressive for the resolution: ISO 3200 produces clean, usable images, and ISO 6400 remains highly usable. The 40MP files are large (50-70MB RAW), requiring fast memory cards.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Autofocus System</h3>
        <p>
          The X-T5 features the latest X-Processor 5 with phase-detection AF covering most of the frame. Subject detection recognizes humans (face/eye), animals, birds, cars, motorcycles, bicycles, and trains. Eye AF is reliable for portrait work, maintaining focus even at shallow depths of field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continuous AF tracking has improved significantly over previous generations. The camera handles predictable motion well—portraits, street photography, casual sports. However, for fast-action sports and wildlife, the X-H2S remains the better choice due to its stacked sensor and faster readout. Low-light AF works reliably down to -4 EV.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
        <p>
          While photo-first, the X-T5 shoots impressive 6.2K 30p video with 10-bit 4:2:2 internal recording. 4K 60p is available in HQ mode with slight crop. F-Log2 provides approximately 13 stops of dynamic range for color grading. Film Simulations apply to video as well, enabling beautiful in-camera looks without grading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rolling shutter is noticeable in the highest resolution modes—the sensor lacks the stacked architecture of the X-H2S. For casual video, run-and-gun shooting, or interviews, quality is excellent. 7-stop IBIS provides effective stabilization for handheld footage. The 3-way tilt screen (not fully articulating) is less ideal for vlogging than the X-H2.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Classic Ergonomics & Build</h3>
        <p>
          The X-T5 embodies Fujifilm's classic design philosophy. Dedicated ISO, shutter speed, and exposure compensation dials provide tactile, intuitive control. The camera is smaller and lighter (557g) than the X-T4 it replaces, returning to the compact heritage of the X-T3. The 3.69M-dot OLED EVF (0.8x magnification) is bright and detailed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 3-way tilt screen is preferred by street and landscape photographers over the X-T4's vari-angle design—it doesn't protrude awkwardly when tilted. Build quality is excellent with magnesium alloy construction and weather sealing (dust/moisture resistant). Battery life provides approximately 580 shots per charge with the NP-W235. Dual UHS-II SD card slots support high-speed storage.

            <p>
              Not at all. The resolution gives you incredible crop potential and
              detail that rivals full-frame 24MP cameras. Files are larger
              (50-70MB RAW), so you'll need fast memory cards and more storage.
              For landscapes and product photography, it's a huge advantage. For
              fast action, the X-H2S is better.

            <p>
              All Fujifilm X-mount lenses work perfectly. Older lenses benefit
              from the higher resolution. The new X-Trans sensor has no
              anti-aliasing filter, so sharp lenses like the 56mm f/1.2 R really
              shine. Budget options like the 18-55mm f/2.8-4 kit lens are
              excellent value.

            </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Film Simulations are Fuji's secret weapon. They're like lens
              filters for your sensor—you can shoot JPEG and get
              publication-ready images straight out of camera. Classics like
              Classic Chrome and Velvia are stunning. You can still shoot
              RAW+JPEG to preserve everything, but many pros rely on JPEGs
              alone.

            </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Yes, it's rated for dust and moisture (not waterproof). You can
              shoot in light rain with weather-sealed lenses like the 16-80mm
              f/4 or 18-55mm. Avoid heavy downpours without a rain cover. The
              dials and buttons are all sealed, making it more rugged than most
              competitors at this price.

            </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Choose the X-T5 for classic controls, lighter weight, and better
              battery life. The X-H2 has a bigger grip, fully articulating
              screen (vs tilt-only on X-T5), and better video specs (8K). If you
              shoot more stills than video and like tactile dials, the X-T5 is
              more enjoyable to use.

        <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          The Fujifilm X-T5 is a photographer's camera through and through.
          With 40MP resolution, classic controls, and Fujifilm's legendary color
          science, it captures images with character you won't find elsewhere.
          The retro design isn't just aesthetic—it's genuinely functional.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buy it if:</strong> You love the photographic process and want a camera that
          inspires creativity. Perfect for street, portrait, and travel photography
          where Fujifilm colors shine.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Skip it if:</strong> You need advanced video features (consider X-S20 or X-H2S),
          or prefer modern touchscreen-first interfaces.
