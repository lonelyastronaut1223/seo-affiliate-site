          <h2 class="product-title">The Verdict</h2>
          <p>
            The OM-5 (formerly Olympus, now OM System) combines Micro Four Thirds' compact size advantage with professional-grade weather-sealing. The 20MP sensor is paired with 8.5-stop IBIS—the best in-body stabilization in any camera under $2,000. This means sharp handheld shots down to 1-2 second exposures without a tripod.
          </p>
          <p>
            At $1,199, it's a niche pick but unbeatable for outdoor adventure. Computational photography features like 50MP handheld high-res shot, Live ND (simulated neutral density filter), and starry sky AF make it a creative powerhouse. The compact MFT lenses mean you can pack a full kit (body + 3 lenses) in a small sling bag.

      <h2 class="section-title">Key Features</h2>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Unmatched Weather-Sealing</h3>
        <p>
          IP53-rated body resists dust, splashes, and freezes down to -10°C. Pair it with weather-sealed PRO lenses (12-40mm f/2.8, 40-150mm f/2.8) and you can shoot in rain, snow, desert sandstorms, or humid jungles without worry. This is gear built for real adventures, not just marketed as such.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>8.5-Stop Image Stabilization</h3>
        <p>
          OM System's IBIS is legendary. The 5-axis sensor-shift system compensates for shake so effectively that you can shoot handheld at shutter speeds that would normally require a tripod. Example: 1/4 second handheld with a 40mm lens (80mm equiv.) produces sharp results. This is transformative for low-light and landscape photography.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Computational Photography</h3>
        <p>
          Handheld Hi-Res Shot captures 8 images and merges them into a 50MP photo—perfect for landscape details. Live ND simulates 5-stop neutral density filters in-camera (no physical filter needed). Starry Sky AF locks onto stars for astrophotography. These computational features leverage the camera's processing power brilliantly.

        <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          The OM System OM-5 is the best rugged travel camera for outdoor photographers in 2026. The weather-sealing and stabilization are unmatched at this price, and the compact MFT ecosystem makes it perfect for hiking and adventure where every gram counts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buy it if:</strong> You hike/travel frequently, shoot in harsh weather, need class-leading IBIS, or want a compact kit with pro durability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Skip it if:</strong> You need the best low-light/ISO performance (full-frame wins), shoot primarily video (autofocus is photo-focused), or want the absolute sharpest files (larger sensors offer more detail).
