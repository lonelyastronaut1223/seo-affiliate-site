                    <p>
                        The Sony ZV-E10 II is essentially an A6700 autofocus system packed into a vlogger-friendly body. With 26MP resolution, 4K60 10-bit video recording, and the NP-FZ100 battery that lasts all day, it solves every complaint from the original ZV-E10.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's our top pick for beginners because Sony E-mount has the largest lens ecosystem in the world - you can find affordable options from Sigma, Tamron, and Viltrox. The camera grows with you.

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Image Quality & Sensor Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    The 26MP APS-C sensor is the same unit found in the A6700, and it shows. Dynamic range exceeds 13 stops, making it forgiving for beginners who might blow highlights or crush shadows. Color science follows Sony's latest natural skin tone tuning, and JPEGs look excellent with Creative Look profiles applied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    High-ISO performance is strong up to ISO 6400 for clean images. Beyond ISO 12800, noise becomes visible but remains usable for web content. For a beginner camera, the sensor punches well above its price point.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Autofocus System</h3>
                <p>
                    This is where the ZV-E10 II truly shines. Sony's latest AI-powered autofocus recognizes humans, animals, birds, insects, cars, trains, and airplanes. Eye AF is rock solid, even when subjects turn away and back. The 759 phase-detection points cover 93% of the frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In real-world use, the camera rarely misses. It's sticky on subjects even during erratic movement, making it ideal for vlogging where you walk toward and away from the camera. Low-light AF remains reliable down to -4 EV.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
                <p>
                    The ZV-E10 II records 4K60 internally in 10-bit 4:2:2 - specs that were flagship-only a few years ago. S-Cinetone gives you cinematic colors without log grading, while S-Log3 is there for colorists who want full control. The camera also supports direct USB streaming for live content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recording limits are generous at 60+ minutes before overheating in moderate temperatures. Heat management is better than the original, though intense direct sunlight still triggers warnings. The vari-angle screen makes selfie-style shooting comfortable.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Ergonomics & Build</h3>
                <p>
                    At 377g, this is a lightweight camera that won't fatigue your wrist during handheld shooting. The grip is shallow but adequate for small-to-medium hands. Button layout is streamlined for video creators, with a prominent record button and background defocus switch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The big upgrade is battery life. The NP-FZ100 battery is the same one used in professional bodies like the A7 IV, offering 610 shots or 2+ hours of video per charge. There's no weather sealing, so protect it in rain or dust.

                    <p>
                        The kit lens is actually quite good. It's tiny, has optical stabilization, and covers the most useful focal lengths. Buy the kit version to save hundreds compared to buying the lens separately.

                        The best all-around upgrade. Constant f/2.8 aperture for consistent exposure in video, excellent sharpness, and compact size. It's the lens we recommend most often for upgraders.

                        <p>
                            Yes, if autofocus and battery life are important to you. The Mark II's AI subject tracking is significantly better, and the NP-FZ100 battery is transformative. If you're happy with the original, wait for prices to drop further.

                        <p>
                            Not for most users. The electronic stabilization (Active Mode) works well for video, and many lenses have optical IS. For stills, you'll need faster shutter speeds in low light, but the sensor is forgiving with high ISO.

                            Choose the ZV-E10 II for video focus, better autofocus, and lens selection. Choose the Canon R50 for easier menus, a viewfinder, and better JPEG colors out of camera. Both are excellent for beginners.
