                    <p>
                        The Sony A7 V is Sony's most ambitious hybrid camera
                        yet, combining the high-resolution imaging of the A7R V
                        with video capabilities that challenge dedicated cinema
                        cameras. The 61MP stacked sensor delivers exceptional
                        detail for both stills and 8K footage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the camera for professionals who refuse to
                        compromise. Whether you're shooting commercial
                        photography, documentary work, or high-end video
                        production, the A7 V provides the tools, reliability,
                        and image quality to deliver world-class results.

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Image Quality & Resolution</h3>
                <p>
                    The 61-megapixel stacked sensor produces images with
                    exceptional detail and clarity. File sizes are substantial
                    (approximately 120MB raw files), but the payoff is
                    extraordinary cropping flexibility and large print
                    capability. The back-illuminated design ensures excellent
                    low-light performance despite the high pixel density.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dynamic range is outstanding at base ISO, rivaling medium
                    format cameras in controlled lighting. The 14-bit raw files
                    capture subtle gradations perfectly, ideal for commercial
                    and landscape photography where maximum quality is
                    paramount.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Autofocus & Tracking</h3>
                <p>
                    Sony's latest AI-powered autofocus system sets a new
                    benchmark. The camera recognizes humans, animals, birds,
                    insects, vehicles, and trains with astonishing accuracy.
                    Real-time Eye AF works flawlessly even with erratic subject
                    movement, making it ideal for wedding photographers and
                    wildlife shooters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 759 phase-detection points cover 94% of the frame, with
                    tracking that sticks to subjects even when they temporarily
                    leave the frame. Focus acquisition speed is
                    near-instantaneous, and the system excels in challenging
                    backlit conditions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
                <p>
                    The A7 V's 8K 30p recording is oversampled from the full
                    sensor width, delivering exceptional sharpness and color
                    accuracy. 4K footage benefits from 6K oversampling,
                    resulting in cleaner images with minimal aliasing. The 4K
                    120p mode enables high-quality slow-motion capture for
                    creative projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heat management is impressive—continuous 8K recording is
                    possible for approximately 60 minutes in normal ambient
                    temperature. The camera includes active stabilization, focus
                    breathing compensation, and a full suite of professional
                    video tools including waveform monitor, zebras, and LUT
                    preview.

                <h3>Build Quality & Ergonomics</h3>
                <p>
                    Sony has refined the A7 series ergonomics significantly. The
                    grip is deeper and more sculpted, providing excellent
                    handling even with large telephoto lenses. Button placement
                    is logical, and the addition of a dedicated photo/video/S&Q
                    switch streamlines workflow for hybrid shooters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 9.44 million dot EVF with 240fps refresh rate is among
                    the best available, providing a smooth, lag-free viewing
                    experience. The 4-axis vari-angle screen combines the
                    versatility of a flip-out design with the ability to quickly
                    position for vertical shooting.

                            The A7 V offers significantly higher resolution
                            (61MP vs 33MP), 8K video capability (vs 4K 60p),
                            improved IBIS (8 stops vs 5.5 stops), and a better
                            EVF. The A7 IV remains an excellent choice for most
                            users, but the A7 V is for professionals who need
                            maximum resolution and advanced video features.

                            8K is primarily useful for future-proofing content,
                            cropping flexibility in post, and delivering
                            oversampled 4K footage. It requires substantial
                            storage (approximately 200GB per hour) and powerful
                            editing hardware. For most users, the 4K modes offer
                            better balance between quality and workflow
                            efficiency.

                        <p>
                            For 8K recording and high-speed burst shooting,
                            CFexpress Type A cards with minimum 800MB/s write
                            speed are recommended. Sony's TOUGH series or
                            ProGrade Digital cards work excellently. For
                            photography-only workflows, high-speed UHS-II SD
                            cards (V90) are sufficient.

                            Sony has made significant improvements to heat
                            management. The A7 V can record 8K continuously for
                            approximately 60 minutes at normal room temperature
                            before overheating. In Auto Temperature settings,
                            the camera manages heat intelligently. For extended
                            recording sessions, using an external recorder via
                            HDMI is recommended.

                            The A7 V is ideal for professional photographers and

                            shooting stills, the A7 IV or A7C II offer better

                <p>
                    The Sony A7 V represents the pinnacle of hybrid camera
                    technology. It's not the camera for everyone—the price point
                    and file sizes demand significant investment and workflow
                    consideration. But for professionals who need the absolute
                    best image quality, the most reliable autofocus, and
                    professional-grade video capabilities, it's an outstanding
                    choice.

                <p>
                    <strong>Buy it if:</strong> You're a professional photographer
                    or videographer who needs maximum resolution, 8K capability, and
                    professional reliability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Skip it if:</strong> You're on a budget, primarily shoot
                    stills, or don't need 8K video—the A7 IV or A7C II offer better
                    value.
