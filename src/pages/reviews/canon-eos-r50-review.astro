                    <p>
                        The Canon EOS R50 is the most beginner-friendly mirrorless camera on the market. Its "Creative Assist" mode explains technical terms in plain language - "Background Blur" instead of "Aperture" - making the learning curve practically non-existent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What sets the R50 apart is Canon's legendary color science. Skin tones look natural and pleasing straight out of camera, so you spend less time editing. It's the camera we recommend to anyone who just wants great photos without the complexity.

        <!-- IN-DEPTH PERFORMANCE -->

            <h2 class="section-title">In-Depth Performance</h2>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Image Quality & Sensor Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    The 24.2MP sensor produces clean, detailed images with Canon's characteristic warmth. Dynamic range is competitive with other APS-C cameras at around 12.5 stops. Where Canon excels is color: skin tones are natural, and the "Portrait" and "Standard" Picture Styles produce images that look finished without editing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ISO performance is solid up to ISO 6400 for everyday use. Beyond that, noise reduction kicks in aggressively, which softens details but keeps images very clean. For social media and web use, ISO 12800 is still very usable.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Autofocus System</h3>
                <p>
                    Canon's Dual Pixel CMOS AF II provides 651 selectable points covering the full frame. Eye detection works reliably for both humans and animals, making it great for portraits and pet photography. The system prioritizes faces intelligently, switching between subjects smoothly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tracking is good but not quite at Sony's level - fast, erratic subjects can sometimes lose lock. For typical beginner scenarios like family photos and travel, it performs flawlessly. Low-light AF is reliable down to -4 EV.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
                <p>
                    The R50 offers 4K30 recording without crop, which is excellent for an entry-level camera. There's also 4K60 available with a 1.6x crop. Video quality is clean and sharp, with good color straight from the camera. Canon Log 3 is available for those who want to grade footage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main limitation is 8-bit recording internally - there's no 10-bit option even via HDMI. For YouTube and social media, 8-bit is perfectly fine. The Movie IS provides good stabilization, though a gimbal is recommended for walking videos.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Ergonomics & Build</h3>
                <p>
                    Canon nailed the form factor. At 375g, it's one of the lightest interchangeable lens cameras available. The grip is shallow but comfortable for smaller hands. The vari-angle touchscreen is responsive and makes selfie shooting easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The EVF is a major advantage over screen-only competitors like the ZV-E10 II. On bright sunny days, you'll appreciate being able to compose through the viewfinder. Battery life at 310 shots is average - carry a spare for long outings.

                        The kit lens is incredibly compact and has built-in IS. It's a great match for the R50's portability and covers the most common focal lengths for beginners.

                        An affordable telephoto for wildlife and sports. The stabilization is excellent, and it pairs well with the kit lens for a complete two-lens kit.

                        <p>
                            Absolutely. The larger sensor captures more light and detail, interchangeable lenses give you creative flexibility, and background blur is real - not computational. For anything beyond casual snapshots, the R50 is a major upgrade.

                        <p>
                            Get the R50 unless budget is extremely tight. The R50 has a viewfinder (EVF), faster burst speed, and better video specs. The R100 saves money but lacks features that make learning photography easier.

                    </h3>
                    <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
                        <p>
                            Yes! All RF lenses work on the R50. You get a 1.6x crop factor, so a 50mm RF lens becomes equivalent to 80mm. This is actually useful for telephoto reach but less ideal for ultra-wide shots.

                <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
                <p>
                    The Canon EOS R50 is the most approachable mirrorless camera we've tested. It won't overwhelm you with menus or features - it just helps you take great photos from day one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Buy it if:</strong> You're new to cameras and want the easiest learning curve, or you prioritize beautiful JPEGs and Canon's colors over video specs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Skip it if:</strong> You need 10-bit video, want the largest lens ecosystem (choose Sony), or plan to shoot professionally and need dual card slots.
