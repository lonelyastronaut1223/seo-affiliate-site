                    <p>
                        The Fujifilm X-T50 packs the flagship 40MP sensor from the X-T5 into a smaller, more affordable body. But the real magic is the Film Simulation dial on top - a physical control that instantly transforms your images with Fuji's legendary film looks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It costs more than other beginner cameras, but you save time on editing. Photos from the X-T50 look finished the moment you click the shutter. It's the camera for people who want photography to feel special.

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Image Quality & Sensor Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    The 40.2MP X-Trans sensor is the same one in the flagship X-T5, and image quality is extraordinary. You get incredible detail for cropping, 14+ stops of dynamic range, and Fuji's unique X-Trans color filter array that eliminates moiré without an anti-aliasing filter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where Fujifilm truly excels is color science. The Film Simulations are developed to mimic classic film stocks, and they look authentic. Provia, Velvia, Classic Negative, and the new Reala Ace each have distinct character. High-ISO performance is excellent up to ISO 6400.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Autofocus System</h3>
                <p>
                    Fujifilm has made huge strides with the X-Processor 5. Subject detection now covers humans, animals, birds, cars, motorcycles, bicycles, airplanes, and trains. Eye AF works reliably in most conditions, and face detection is accurate even at angles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That said, it's not quite at Sony's level for fast, erratic subjects. For street photography, portraits, and travel - the typical X-T50 use cases - autofocus is excellent. It's only in sports or wildlife action that you might want something faster.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
                <p>
                    Video specs are impressive: 6.2K Open Gate for maximum flexibility, 4K60 for smooth motion, and 10-bit 4:2:2 internal recording. The camera even records ProRes internally, which was unheard of at this price point. Film Simulations work in video for beautiful straight-out-of-camera footage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heat management limits continuous recording to around 30 minutes in 4K60. The 5-axis IBIS helps with handheld video, though electronic stabilization adds additional crop. For hybrid shooters, the X-T50 is highly capable.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Ergonomics & Build</h3>
                <p>
                    The retro design with physical dials is part of Fuji's identity. The dedicated Film Simulation dial on top is the X-T50's signature feature - rotate it to switch between looks without entering menus. ISO and Shutter Speed dials add to the analog shooting experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At 438g, it's slightly heavier than competitors but still very portable. The 3" tilting screen works for most angles but isn't fully articulating. EVF quality is good at 2.36M dots. Battery life is the main weakness at 305 shots per charge.

                    <p>
                        The pancake lens makes the X-T50 ultralight and pocketable. On APS-C, 27mm gives you a 40mm equivalent - ideal for street and everyday photography.

                        Classic focal length (53mm equivalent) with fast aperture and weather resistance. Sharp, compact, and great for portraits and low-light work.

                        Fuji's "kit" lens is actually excellent. Fast aperture range, optical stabilization, and sharpness that rivals primes. Essential for travel.

                            Same 40MP sensor and processor. The X-T5 has a larger EVF, dual card slots, and classic three-dial design. The X-T50 adds the Film Simulation dial and is smaller/lighter. For most users, the X-T50 is sufficient.

                    <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
                        <p>
                            They're different. Film Simulations apply at capture and affect the RAW data, giving you authentic Fuji colors even in RAW files. Lightroom presets are post-processing effects. Many photographers prefer shooting JPEGs on Fuji cameras because the Film Simulations look so good.

                        <p>
                            No, high resolution is always an advantage. You get more room to crop, larger print capability, and better detail. File sizes are larger (around 80MB RAW), so get a fast SD card. The 40MP sensor is pure benefits.

                <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
                <p>
                    The Fujifilm X-T50 is the most inspiring camera on this list. It rewards you with beautiful images straight from the camera and makes the creative process feel tactile and intentional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Buy it if:</strong> You want photography to feel special, value aesthetic output over technical specs, and don't mind paying extra for the experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Skip it if:</strong> Budget is a primary concern, you need the absolute fastest autofocus, or you prefer a fully articulating screen for vlogging.
