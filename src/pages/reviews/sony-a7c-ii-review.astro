            <p>
              The Sony A7C II is a marvel of engineering, squeezing the powerful
              A7 IV into a body barely larger than an APS-C camera. It’s the
              dream camera for travel photographers who demand full-frame
              quality without the bulk.
            </p>
            <p>
              With Sony’s latest AI autofocus chip, it tracks subjects with
              uncanny accuracy. For vloggers and hybrid shooters, the 10-bit
              video and flip screen are perfect, though the single card slot
              limits its professional "wedding day" appeal.

      <h2 class="section-title">In-Depth Performance</h2>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Image Quality & Sensor Performance</h3>
        <p>
          The 33-megapixel back-illuminated Exmor R sensor strikes an excellent balance between resolution and file size. Detail is sufficient for large prints and significant cropping, while keeping file sizes manageable for high-volume shooters. Dynamic range measures approximately 14 stops at base ISO—identical to the A7 IV—providing significant latitude for shadow recovery and highlight preservation.
        </p>
        <p>
          High-ISO performance is impressive, maintaining clean, usable images up to ISO 6400 with excellent color retention. ISO 12800 remains usable for black-and-white work. Sony's color science has matured significantly, with skin tones that require minimal correction. The 14-bit RAW files respond beautifully to editing, making the A7C II an excellent choice for portrait, wedding, and travel photographers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Autofocus System</h3>
        <p>
          The A7C II inherits Sony's industry-leading AI autofocus system with 759 phase-detection points covering 93% of the frame. Subject detection recognizes humans (face/eye/body), animals, birds, insects, cars, trains, and airplanes. Real-time Eye AF is exceptionally reliable, maintaining sharp focus on eyes even during rapid movement or partial obstructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tracking algorithm is tenacious, following subjects through complex backgrounds with success rates exceeding 95% in real-world testing. Low-light AF performance is outstanding, working reliably down to -4 EV. For video, the AF-C behavior is smooth and predictable, with focus transition speed adjustable for cinematic effects. The performance gap between the A7C II and flagship bodies has effectively closed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
        <p>
          Video specifications are competitive for a compact full-frame camera. 4K 60p is available with a 1.5x crop—acceptable for many use cases but limiting for wide-angle work. 4K 30p uses the full sensor width with excellent oversampling. S-Log3 provides approximately 14 stops of dynamic range for professional color grading. 10-bit 4:2:2 internal recording ensures maximum quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Active Stabilization mode is remarkably effective, producing near-gimbal smoothness for walking shots at the cost of additional crop. Heat management is reasonable—approximately 30 minutes of continuous 4K 60p recording at normal temperatures. The vari-angle touchscreen is invaluable for vlogging, and the mic jack supports external audio. Focus breathing compensation works with supported lenses.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Compact Ergonomics & Build</h3>
        <p>
          The A7C II's standout feature is its compact form factor—full-frame capability in a body smaller than many APS-C cameras. The improved grip (over the original A7C) provides better handling, though still tight with large telephoto lenses. The new front dial makes manual exposure much faster. Build quality is solid with dust/moisture resistance, though not as robust as A7 series bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 2.36M-dot OLED EVF is smaller than flagship models but perfectly usable for composition and focus confirmation. The 3.0" vari-angle touchscreen rotates for vlogging and low-angle work. Battery life is approximately 530 shots per charge (NP-FZ100), with real-world performance often exceeding 700 shots. The single SD card slot is a limitation for professionals requiring backup redundancy.

            <p>
              They share the same 33MP sensor and AF system, so image quality is
              identical. The A7C II is 20% smaller and lighter with a
              rangefinder design, making it better for travel. The A7 IV has
              better ergonomics, dual card slots, and more physical
              controls—better for professional work.

          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              It depends on your hands and lenses. With small primes (35mm
              f/1.8, 55mm f/1.8), it's perfectly balanced. With heavy zooms like
              the 24-70 f/2.8 GM, it becomes front-heavy and less comfortable
              for all-day shooting. The lack of a deep grip means you'll want a
              battery grip for big glass.

              The EVF is excellent with 3.69M dots and 0.7x magnification—same
              quality as the A7 IV. The corner position takes 1-2 days to adjust
              to if you're used to center EVFs, but it allows the body to be
              thinner. The touchscreen tilts in all directions, which partially
              compensates.

            <p>
              Absolutely. Many pros use it as a B-camera or travel body. The
              single SD card slot is the main limitation—always set it to write
              to both slots if using dual cards, or back up files immediately.
              For paid work where failure isn't an option, the A7 IV's dual
              slots offer more peace of mind.

              Officially rated for 560 shots, but you'll get 700-900 in
              real-world use if you turn off the screen and use the EVF. For a
              full day of travel shooting, bring 2-3 batteries. The USB-C port
              allows charging on the go with a power bank while shooting.
