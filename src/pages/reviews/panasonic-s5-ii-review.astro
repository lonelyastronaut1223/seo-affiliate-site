          <h2 class="product-title">The Verdict</h2>
          <p>
            For years, Panasonic cameras had amazing video specs but terrible
            autofocus. The S5 II changed everything by adding **Phase Detect
            AF**.
          </p>
          <p>
            It combines this new customized AF with the best In-Body Image
            Stabilization (IBIS) in the business. You can walk and talk without
            a gimbal, and shoot 6K video that looks like a cinema camera. For
            solo filmmakers, this is the one to beat.
          </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">In-Depth Performance</h2>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Image Quality & Sensor Performance</h3>
        <p>
          The 24.2-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor delivers excellent image quality with good dynamic range (approximately 13.5 stops at base ISO). The dual native ISO (640 and 4000) minimizes noise at common video ISOs, making this camera exceptionally clean in low light. Color science is pleasing and natural, with skin tones that require minimal correction.
        </p>
        <p>
          High-ISO performance is outstanding—ISO 6400 produces clean, professional-grade images and ISO 12800 remains highly usable. The Venus Engine processor handles noise reduction intelligently, preserving detail while smoothing noise. For challenging lighting situations (concerts, events, nighttime), the S5 II is among the best performers in its class.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Phase-Detect Autofocus</h3>
        <p>
          The S5 II represents a complete transformation for Panasonic. The new phase-detect AF system eliminates the "hunting" and "pulsing" focus behavior of previous Panasonic cameras. 779 AF points cover the entire frame, with subject detection for humans (face/eye/body), animals, and vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tracking is smooth and reliable for video work—precisely what videographers need. For single-person interviews or vlogging, autofocus is essentially flawless. For fast-action sports, it's not quite at Sony's level, but for 95% of video work, the AF performs with professional reliability. The improvement over the original S5 is transformative.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Open Gate Video & Recording</h3>
        <p>
          The S5 II shoots stunning 6K 30p Open Gate video using the entire sensor area (3:2 aspect ratio). This enables flexible reframing in post—extracting 16:9 horizontal AND 9:16 vertical content from a single clip. For creators shooting for multiple platforms, this workflow is invaluable. V-Log provides approximately 14 stops of dynamic range for color grading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Internal recording is 10-bit 4:2:2 with unlimited recording time thanks to the built-in cooling fan. The fan is nearly silent and prevents overheating entirely. 4K 120p is available for buttery slow motion. ProRes recording requires the S5 IIX variant, but for most creators, the standard codec options are more than sufficient.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Active I.S. & Build Quality</h3>
        <p>
          Panasonic's Active I.S. is among the best in the industry. The system combines 5-axis IBIS (rated 8 stops) with electronic stabilization for remarkably smooth handheld footage. Walking shots that would require a gimbal on other cameras are achievable handheld on the S5 II. This single feature is a game-changer for solo filmmakers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Build quality is robust with magnesium alloy construction and comprehensive weather sealing. The deep grip accommodates all-day shooting with heavy lenses. The 3.0" free-angle touchscreen and 2.36M-dot EVF are functional if not class-leading. Battery life drains faster in high-res modes, so spare batteries are essential. Weight (740g) is heavier than Sony/Canon equivalents but feels balanced.

            <p>
              The biggest upgrade is phase-detect autofocus—the original S5 had
              slow contrast-detect AF. The S5 II also adds USB-C recording,
              improved IBIS (8 stops), and better heat management. It's a
              completely different camera in terms of usability.

          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Not anymore. Sigma, Leica, and Panasonic all make L-mount lenses.
              You have access to affordable Sigma Art lenses and high-end Leica
              glass. Third-party options from TTArtisan and Viltrox expand
              choices further. L-mount is smaller than Sony E or Canon RF, but
              growing steadily.

          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              The IIX is identical hardware with unlocked video features: ProRes
              RAW, waveforms, and USB-C RAW output. If you're a serious video
              creator, the IIX is worth the extra $500. For hybrid shooters or
              photo-focused users, the standard S5 II is plenty.

          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

              Slightly better. The S5 II maxes at ISO 204,800 (vs 102,400 on A7
              IV) and produces cleaner files at high ISOs. The dual native ISO
              design (ISO 640 and 4000) means noise is minimal at common video
              ISOs. For nighttime event shooting, the S5 II has an edge.

          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              For many creators, yes. Unlimited 6K recording, 10-bit 4:2:2
              internal, and V-Log make it a legitimate cinema tool. It lacks
              built-in ND filters and XLR inputs (requires DMW-XLR1 adapter),
              but the image quality rivals cameras 3-4x the price. Pair it with
              a Ninja V for ProRes recording.
