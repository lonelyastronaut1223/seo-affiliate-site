          <p class="hero-sub">
            The DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro is DJI's serious challenge to GoPro's throne. With magnetic quick-release mounting, 4-hour battery life (4x longer than GoPro), dual touchscreens, and 4K120 recording, it matches or beats the Hero 13 in almost every category—while costing $50 less.

          <h2 class="product-title">The Verdict</h2>
          <p>
            The Action 5 Pro's standout innovation is the magnetic mounting system. Attach magnetically, twist to lock—takes 1 second vs GoPro's fiddly fingers system. The 1950 mAh battery lasts 4 hours of 1080p recording (vs Hero 13's ~70 minutes), making it viable for all-day adventures without battery swaps.
          </p>
          <p>
            At $349, it undercuts the Hero 13 ($399) while offering comparable stabilization, dual screens (front OLED + rear touch), and 4K120. DJI's RockSteady 3.0+ stabilization is excellent, and the 155° ultra-wide FOV captures more of the scene. For users not locked into GoPro's ecosystem, the Action 5 Pro is the better value.

      <h2 class="section-title">Key Features</h2>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Magnetic Mounting System</h3>
        <p>
          DJI's quick-release magnetic mount is transformative. Slap the camera onto a mount, twist 90° to lock. Remove with a twist. No fumbling with GoPro's fingers in cold weather or with gloves. The magnetic ecosystem (chest mount, helmet, handlebar) all work instantly. This alone is reason to switch.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Extreme Battery Life</h3>
        <p>
          4 hours of 1080p60 recording from a single 1950 mAh battery is unprecedented for action cams. Even 4K60 lasts ~2 hours. This means all-day skiing, surfing, or biking without carrying 5 spare batteries like GoPro users. The battery charges via USB-C and can charge while recording (power bank support).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Dual Screens & Stabilization</h3>
        <p>
          Front OLED screen (for vlogging self-framing) + rear 2.4" touchscreen. RockSteady 3.0+ stabilization with HorizonSteady (keeps horizon level like GoPro's Horizon Lock). 10-bit D-Log M for color grading flexibility. Waterproof to 20m without case (vs GoPro's 10m). It's a feature-packed beast.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          The DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro is the best action camera value in 2026. The magnetic mounting, extreme battery life, and dual screens make it more practical than the GoPro Hero 13 for real-world use. Unless you're invested in GoPro's ecosystem, the Action 5 Pro is the smarter choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buy it if:</strong> You want the longest battery life, prefer magnetic mounting, need dual screens, or value innovation over brand loyalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Skip it if:</strong> You already own GoPro mounts (not compatible), need the absolute best stabilization (Hero 13 edges ahead), or want the most tested/proven platform.
