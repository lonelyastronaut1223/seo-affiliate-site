          <h2 class="product-title">The Verdict</h2>
          <p>
            The Canon R6 Mark II is the second generation of Canon's speed-focused full-frame hybrid. It packs a 24MP sensor optimized for responsiveness, not resolution. With 40fps electronic burst and pre-capture RAW, you'll never miss the decisive moment.
          </p>

    <!-- IN-DEPTH PERFORMANCE -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">In-Depth Performance</h2>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Speed & Autofocus</h3>
        <p>
          The R6 II's 40fps electronic shutter is absurdly fast. Paired with Canon's Dual Pixel CMOS AF II, it locks onto subjects with near-perfect accuracy. The Deep Learning AF recognizes people, animals (dogs, cats, birds), and vehicles (cars, motorcycles). Eye detection works even when subjects are tiny in the frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pre-capture RAW feature is game-changing for unpredictable action. Half-press the shutter, and the camera buffers 0.5 seconds of RAW frames. When you fully press, you get shots from *before* you reacted. It's like time travel for wildlife and sports photography.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Image Quality</h3>
        <p>
          The 24MP sensor might seem modest compared to high-res competitors, but it delivers. Dynamic range is excellent—about 14 stops in RAW. Colors are classic Canon: warm, pleasing skin tones straight out of camera. High-ISO performance is stellar—ISO 6400 is totally usable, and ISO 12,800 is acceptable with minimal noise reduction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lower resolution means larger photosites, which translates to better low-light sensitivity. If you're shooting events, concerts, or indoor sports, the R6 II punches above its megapixel weight. Just don't expect massive crops or billboard-sized prints.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
        <p>
          Canon fixed the R6's biggest weakness: 4K60 is now fully uncropped with oversampled 6K quality. Rolling shutter is minimal—far better than Sony A7 IV. You get 10-bit 4:2:2 internal recording with C-Log3 for maximum grading flexibility. The focus breathing compensation is clutch for video work.
        </p>
        <p>
          4K120 for slow motion is available but crops to 1.2x (APS-C mode). Heat management is solid—no overheating in normal conditions, though long 4K60 sessions on hot days may trigger limits. The dual SD card slots can record simultaneously for instant backups.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Ergonomics & Build</h3>
        <p>
          Canon nailed the ergonomics. The R6 II has a deep, secure grip, well-placed controls, and a joystick that's perfect for quick AF point selection. The vari-angle LCD is ideal for vlogging and high/low angles. The EVF refresh rate goes up to 120fps for smooth tracking.
       </p>
        <p>
          Weather sealing is robust—this camera can handle rain, dust, and snow. Battery life (CIPA rated 760 shots) is decent but drops significantly with 40fps bursts enabled. Carry spares if you're shooting all day. The dual SD slots use UHS-II for fast write speeds, though CFexpress would've been nice for 40fps bursts.

            The ultimate walk-around lens. Constant f/2.8, fast AF, and built-in stabilization complement the R6 II's speed. Perfect for events, weddings, and general shooting.
          </p>

        <div class="recommendation-card">
          <h4>Canon RF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM</h4>
          <p>
            Sports and wildlife powerhouse. Incredibly sharp, fast focusing, and lightweight for a 70-200 f/2.8. The R6 II's 40fps makes this combo unstoppable for action.
          </p>

          <h4>Canon RF 85mm f/1.2L USM</h4>

            Portrait perfection. The insane bokeh and sharpness pair beautifully with the R6 II's subject tracking. Eye-AF never loses lock, even wide open at f/1.2.

            <p>
              The R6 II is faster (40fps vs 10fps) with better autofocus tracking and superior video rolling shutter. The A7 IV has higher resolution (33MP vs 24MP) and better lens ecosystem value. Choose R6 II for speed/action, A7 IV for resolution/versatility.

          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Yes, for most use cases. 24MP prints beautifully up to 16x20 inches and allows moderate cropping. The lower resolution enables faster burst speeds, better low-light performance, and smaller file sizes. Only landscape photographers printing huge need more MP.

            <p>
              Much improved. Canon redesigned the heat management. You can record 4K60 for 30+ minutes in normal conditions without overheating. The original R6 would overheat in 15-20 minutes. Still not as robust as Panasonic's active cooling, but totally viable for professional video work.

    <!-- FINAL RECOMMENDATION -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="final-verdict">
        <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          The Canon R6 Mark II is the ultimate speed-focused hybrid camera. With 40fps burst, pre-capture RAW, and 4K60 uncropped video, it's built for professionals who can't afford to miss the shot. Canon's autofocus is industry-leading, and the RF lens lineup is maturing beautifully.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buy it if:</strong> You shoot sports, wildlife, events, or action-heavy content. You need Canon's color science and want the fastest hybrid camera on the market under $3000.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Skip it if:</strong> You prioritize resolution over speed (get R5 II), want smaller file sizes (get R8), or need the absolute best value (Sony A7 IV offers more MP for less money).
