          <h2 class="product-title">The Verdict</h2>
          <p>
            The Nikon Z8 is essentially a "baby Z9." It has no mechanical
            shutter because it doesn't need one—the sensor readout is instantly
            fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            For pros who switch between high-res wedding portraits and 8K video,
            this is the ultimate hybrid. It’s bigger than a Sony A7 IV but feels
            incredibly balanced with pro lenses.
          </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">In-Depth Performance</h2>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Image Quality & Sensor Performance</h3>
        <p>
          The 45.7-megapixel stacked CMOS sensor delivers exceptional image quality with outstanding dynamic range of approximately 14+ stops at base ISO. The stacked architecture enables remarkably fast readout with virtually zero rolling shutter—a first for full-frame cameras. Detail is exceptional, resolving fine textures in landscapes, architecture, and commercial work with medium format-like clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          High-ISO performance is impressive for the resolution class—ISO 6400 produces clean, usable images with excellent color retention. The EXPEED 7 processor enables efficient noise reduction while preserving detail. Color science is classic Nikon: accurate, neutral, and highly responsive to editing. The 14-bit RAW files contain exceptional latitude for post-processing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Autofocus & 3D Tracking</h3>
        <p>
          Nikon has finally caught up—and arguably surpassed—the competition. The 3D Tracking system is remarkably sticky, maintaining focus on fast-moving subjects through complex backgrounds. Subject detection recognizes people (face/eye), animals (dogs, cats, birds), and vehicles (cars, motorcycles, airplanes, trains) with impressive accuracy. The system switches between subjects intelligently.
        </p>
        <p>
          With 493 AF points covering approximately 90% of the frame, there's minimal need to recompose. Low-light AF works reliably down to -7 EV with fast lenses. The Pre-Release Capture buffers up to 1 second of images before the shutter is fully pressed, ensuring you never miss the decisive moment. Burst shooting at 20 fps (RAW) is fast enough for any action.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
        <p>
          The Z8 is one of very few cameras offering internal 8K 60p N-RAW recording—12-bit footage that's extraordinarily malleable in post. 4K 120p provides buttery smooth slow motion with excellent detail. N-Log and HLG profiles deliver approximately 13 stops of dynamic range. ProRes RAW HQ is available for external recording via the full-size HDMI port.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heat management is excellent for a fanless design—8K recording is sustainable for 90+ minutes with latest firmware. 4K 60p is essentially unlimited. The 4-way tilting screen (including vertical orientation) is invaluable for video work. Rolling shutter is virtually eliminated thanks to the stacked sensor. Focus breathing compensation works with supported Z-mount lenses.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Ergonomics & Build</h3>
        <p>
          The Z8 is designed for working professionals. The deep grip accommodates even large telephoto lenses comfortably, and the backlit buttons enable confident operation in darkness. The 3.69M-dot OLED EVF (0.8x magnification) is bright and lag-free with minimal blackout during continuous shooting. The 4-way tilting screen is a portrait photographer's dream.
        </p>
        <p>
          Build quality is exceptional with full magnesium alloy construction and comprehensive weather sealing. The EN-EL15c battery provides approximately 340 shots per charge (CIPA)—average for mirrorless but supplemented by USB-C Power Delivery for continuous operation. Dual CFexpress Type B slots handle the massive file sizes from 8K video and high-resolution bursts. Weight (910g) is heavier than Sony/Canon equivalents but feels balanced with pro lenses.

            <p>
              If you shoot professional sports, wildlife, or events—yes. The Z8
              has 45MP (vs 24MP), faster burst speeds, 8K video, and dual
              CFexpress slots. The Z6 III is excellent for most users, but the
              Z8's resolution and speed justify the price for demanding work.

            <p>
              They're extremely close. The Z8 is $1500 cheaper, has better
              ergonomics, and superior battery life. The A1 has a slight edge in
              autofocus refinement and lens selection. Both are class-leading
              hybrid cameras—choose based on lens ecosystem. If you're already
              in Nikon glass, the Z8 is a no-brainer.

          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Start with the 24-120mm f/4 S for versatility, or the 24-70mm
              f/2.8 S if you need f/2.8. For sports/wildlife, the 100-400mm
              f/4.5-5.6 VR S is phenomenal. The 50mm f/1.8 S is cheap and
              tack-sharp. Avoid adapted F-mount lenses—native Z glass unlocks
              the camera's full potential.

              Nikon engineered excellent heat dissipation. With the latest
              firmware, you can record 8K for 90+ minutes continuously. In 4K60,
              overheating is essentially a non-issue. The fanless design stays
              silent, making it perfect for interviews and quiet environments.

            <p>
              The Z8 is arguably the best mirrorless camera for wildlife. The
              20fps RAW burst, pre-release capture, and subject detection
              (birds, animals) are incredible. Pair it with the 180-600mm
              f/5.6-6.3 VR or the 400mm f/4.5 S for reach. File management is
              critical—invest in dual 256GB CFexpress cards minimum.
