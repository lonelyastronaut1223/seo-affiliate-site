          <h2 class="product-title">The Verdict</h2>
          <p>
            The Nikon Z8 is essentially a "baby Z9." It has no mechanical
            shutter because it doesn't need one—the sensor readout is instantly
            fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            For pros who switch between high-res wedding portraits and 8K video,
            this is the ultimate hybrid. It’s bigger than a Sony A7 IV but feels
            incredibly balanced with pro lenses.
          </p>

            This is one of the few cameras that shoots 8K 60p N-RAW internally.
            The footage is malleable and stunning. For most users, the 4K 120p
            is the sweet spot for buttery smooth slow motion.

            <p>
              If you shoot professional sports, wildlife, or events—yes. The Z8
              has 45MP (vs 24MP), faster burst speeds, 8K video, and dual
              CFexpress slots. The Z6 III is excellent for most users, but the
              Z8's resolution and speed justify the price for demanding work.

            <p>
              They're extremely close. The Z8 is $1500 cheaper, has better
              ergonomics, and superior battery life. The A1 has a slight edge in
              autofocus refinement and lens selection. Both are class-leading
              hybrid cameras—choose based on lens ecosystem. If you're already
              in Nikon glass, the Z8 is a no-brainer.

          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Start with the 24-120mm f/4 S for versatility, or the 24-70mm
              f/2.8 S if you need f/2.8. For sports/wildlife, the 100-400mm
              f/4.5-5.6 VR S is phenomenal. The 50mm f/1.8 S is cheap and
              tack-sharp. Avoid adapted F-mount lenses—native Z glass unlocks
              the camera's full potential.

            <p>
              Nikon engineered excellent heat dissipation. With the latest
              firmware, you can record 8K for 90+ minutes continuously. In 4K60,
              overheating is essentially a non-issue. The fanless design stays
              silent, making it perfect for interviews and quiet environments.

            <p>
              The Z8 is arguably the best mirrorless camera for wildlife. The
              20fps RAW burst, pre-release capture, and subject detection
              (birds, animals) are incredible. Pair it with the 180-600mm
              f/5.6-6.3 VR or the 400mm f/4.5 S for reach. File management is
              critical—invest in dual 256GB CFexpress cards minimum.
