    <!-- IN-DEPTH PERFORMANCE -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">In-Depth Performance</h2>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Image Quality & Sensor Performance</h3>
        <p>
          The 24.1MP back-illuminated stacked sensor prioritizes speed and low-light capability over pure resolution. Dynamic range is outstanding—approximately 14.5 stops at base ISO, with excellent shadow recovery in Canon's RAW files. The sensor design minimizes rolling shutter artifacts even at 40fps electronic shutter speeds. Color science is Canon's signature natural rendering with accurate skin tones that require minimal post-processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          High-ISO performance is exceptional. ISO 6400 produces remarkably clean files, and ISO 12,800 remains highly usable for critical work. The native ISO 102,400 ceiling pushes low-light capabilities far beyond most competitors. For wedding photographers, event shooters, and photojournalists working in challenging lighting, this sensor is a revelation. The 24MP resolution proves sufficient for editorial work and large prints up to 24×36 inches.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Autofocus System</h3>
        <p>
          Canon's Dual Pixel CMOS AF II with Deep Learning is frighteningly accurate. The 1,053 AF zones cover virtually the entire frame with exceptional reliability. Subject detection identifies humans (face/eye/body), animals, birds, and vehicles with minimal user input. The system automatically switches between detection types, or you can lock to specific subjects. Eye AF works reliably even with subjects wearing glasses, masks, or partial profile views.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tracking performance is where the R6 III truly shines. Once locked onto a subject, the camera maintains focus through complex movements, partial obstructions, and cluttered backgrounds. The pre-continuous shooting mode captures 20 frames (0.5 seconds) before full shutter press—invaluable for unpredictable sports moments. Low-light AF functions down to -6.5 EV, making it effective in near darkness. The combination of speed and accuracy makes this Canon's most dependable AF system yet.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
        <p>
          The R6 III is a serious cinema tool. Internal 6K 60p RAW recording provides exceptional flexibility for color grading and VFX work. Oversampled 4K from 6K source delivers incredible sharpness with minimal aliasing. 4K 120p slow motion opens creative possibilities without external recorders. Canon Log 2 and Log 3 profiles capture over 16 stops of dynamic range—matching dedicated cinema cameras. All video modes support 10-bit 4:2:2 internal recording to CFexpress cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thermal management is excellent—continuous 4K 60p recording exceeds 2 hours at normal temperatures. The 8.5-stop IBIS produces remarkably stable handheld footage, though a gimbal remains beneficial for walking shots. Dual Pixel AF works flawlessly in video mode with smooth face tracking. False color, waveforms, and focus peaking aid professional workflows. HDMI 2.1 output enables 6K RAW to Atomos or Blackmagic external recorders for extended recording durations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Ergonomics & Build</h3>
        <p>
          Canon refined the R6 body design with improved grip depth and button spacing. The magnesium alloy chassis feels substantial without excessive weight. Button layout is intuitive with well-placed dials and a multi-function joystick for quick AF point selection. The 5.76M-dot EVF is excellent—bright, sharp, and responsive with minimal blackout during 40fps shooting. The vari-angle touchscreen is fully articulating for vlogging and awkward angles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Build quality inspires confidence with comprehensive weather sealing suitable for harsh environments. The LP-E6NH battery provides approximately 760 shots per charge via LCD, with real-world performance often exceeding 1,000 shots in moderate use. Dual CFexpress Type B / SD card slots offer flexibility—use CFe for maximum performance or SD for cost savings. USB-C Power Delivery enables infinite runtime when powered externally. The multi-function shoe supports Canon accessories and wireless transmitters.

          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Major upgrades include 40fps burst (vs 20fps), pre-continuous shooting, improved AF with more detection options, 6K RAW video (vs 4K), and enhanced IBIS (8.5 vs 8 stops). The R6 III also features better heat management and extended battery life. If you shoot fast action or need maximum video flexibility, the upgrade is substantial.

              Is 24MP enough resolution for professional work?
            </button>
          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Absolutely. 24MP is sufficient for editorial publishing, large prints up to 24×36 inches, and most commercial applications. The trade-off enables superior low-light performance, faster processing speeds, smaller file sizes, and longer buffer capacity. If you regularly shoot landscapes or architecture requiring extreme cropping, consider the 45MP R5 II instead.

          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Pre-continuous mode continuously buffers frames, so when you fully press the shutter, the camera saves frames captured 0.5 seconds BEFORE the press (20 frames at 40fps). This is revolutionary for unpredictable moments—wildlife takeoffs, sports decisive moments, or candid expressions. You literally capture moments that happened before you reacted.

          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              The R6 III is ideal for professional sports, wildlife, wedding, and event photographers who prioritize speed and reliability. Hybrid shooters needing serious video capabilities (6K RAW, C-Log 3) alongside fast stills will find it perfect. It's particularly suited for low-light specialists and those migrating from Canon EOS-1D X DSLRs seeking mirrorless speed advantages.

    <!-- FINAL RECOMMENDATION -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="final-verdict">
        <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          The Canon R6 Mark III represents the apex of hybrid speed performance. It's not the highest resolution Canon (that's the R5 II), but for photographers and filmmakers who value responsiveness, low-light capability, and video excellence, it's unmatched. The combination of 40fps, pre-shooting, and 6K RAW internal recording sets a new professional standard.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buy it if:</strong> You shoot fast-moving subjects (sports, wildlife, events), need exceptional low-light performance, require serious video capabilities, or want Canon's most responsive camera for professional hybrid work.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Skip it if:</strong> You primarily shoot landscapes/architecture requiring maximum resolution (choose R5 II), have a tight budget (R6 II offers excellent value), or shoot mostly static subjects where speed isn't critical.
