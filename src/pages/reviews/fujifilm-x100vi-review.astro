                        The X100VI is the camera that broke the internet. With a 40MP sensor, IBIS, and Fuji's beloved 23mm f/2 lens in a pocketable body, it's the compact camera enthusiasts have dreamed of for years.

                    <p>
                        The X100VI takes everything great about the X100V and adds IBIS (a first for the X100 series) and the flagship 40MP sensor. It's exceptionally sharp, handles beautifully, and produces images with that distinct Fuji character that fans love.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, it has a fixed lens - the 23mm f/2 (35mm equivalent). But that constraint is liberating. You grab it, shoot, and get incredible results. It's the camera that makes you want to take photos.

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Image Quality & Sensor Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    The 40.2MP sensor is stunning in the X100VI. Combined with the exceptional 23mm f/2 lens that's been refined over generations, you get corner-to-corner sharpness that rivals medium format output. Detail rendering is incredible, and the 14+ stops of dynamic range handle challenging light beautifully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Film Simulations shine here. Classic Negative for street photography, Provia for travel, Velvia for landscapes - each gives you a distinct, beautiful look without post-processing. JPEG shooters will be in heaven.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>The 23mm f/2 Lens</h3>
                <p>
                    This lens is the reason the X100 series exists. The 35mm equivalent field of view is versatile for street, travel, and environmental portraits. At f/2, you get lovely background separation while maintaining environmental context. It focuses to 10cm with a macro switch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Optional WCL and TCL conversion lenses give you 28mm and 50mm equivalents respectively, adding flexibility when needed. But the beauty of the X100VI is the constraint - one focal length makes you a better photographer.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>IBIS - Game Changer</h3>
                <p>
                    The addition of 6-stop IBIS to the X100 series is transformative. Previous models struggled in low light with the f/2 limit - now you can shoot at 1/4 second handheld and get sharp results. For night street photography and dimly lit interiors, this is massive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Video also benefits significantly. Handheld footage is much smoother, making the X100VI a capable B-roll camera for video creators who want pocket-sized gear.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Hybrid Viewfinder</h3>
                <p>
                    The X100VI's hybrid OVF/EVF is unique in photography. Flip a lever and you switch between optical and electronic viewfinders. The OVF shows the world directly with frame lines - a true rangefinder experience. The EVF gives you exposure preview and focus peaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This dual nature is part of the X100 magic. Street photographers love the OVF for its zero lag and ability to see outside the frame lines. The EVF is there when you need precision.

                        <p>
                            Limiting in the best way. The 35mm equivalent teaches you composition and makes you move. Most photographers find it liberating rather than restrictive. If you need versatility, get an interchangeable lens camera.

                            If IBIS and the 40MP sensor matter to you, yes. The X100V is still excellent though. If you're happy with it and don't need low-light stabilization or extra resolution, keep shooting.

                    The Fujifilm X100VI is a modern classic. It combines flagship image quality with true pocketability in a way no other camera matches. If you can find one at retail price, don't hesitate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Buy it if:</strong> You want a premium compact for travel and street photography, love Fuji's Film Simulations, and appreciate the focused experience of a fixed lens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Skip it if:</strong> You need zoom flexibility, can't justify the price for a fixed-lens camera, or need immediate availability.
