            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Image Quality & Sensor Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    The 26-megapixel X-Trans CMOS 5 HR sensor delivers exceptional image quality that rivals cameras costing twice as much. Fujifilm's unique X-Trans color filter array eliminates the need for an optical low-pass filter, resulting in outstanding sharpness and detail rendition. Dynamic range measures approximately 13 stops at base ISO, providing significant latitude for recovering highlights and shadows in post-processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    High-ISO performance is impressive for an APS-C sensor—ISO 3200 produces clean, usable images with excellent color retention, and even ISO 6400 maintains strong detail with minimal noise reduction. The 19 Film Simulations are a standout feature, delivering stunning JPEG files straight out of camera. Favorites like Classic Chrome, Velvia, and the newer Nostalgic Neg provide distinct looks that would require significant post-processing on other systems.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Autofocus System</h3>
                <p>
                    The X-S20 inherits the advanced phase-detection AF system from the X-H2S flagship, featuring 425 AF points covering approximately 100% of the frame. Subject detection recognizes humans (face/eye), animals (dogs, cats, birds), and vehicles (cars, motorcycles, bicycles, airplanes, trains). Eye detection is remarkably reliable, maintaining focus even when subjects are partially obscured or at acute angles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Continuous AF tracking has improved significantly over previous generations. The camera maintains focus on moving subjects with tenacity comparable to Sony's renowned system. Low-light AF performance is excellent, working reliably down to -4 EV. For video shooters, the AF-C behavior is smooth and predictable, avoiding the "hunting" behavior that plagued earlier Fujifilm cameras. Focus transition speed can be adjusted for cinematic rack-focus effects.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
                <p>
                    Video is where the X-S20 truly punches above its weight class. Internal 6.2K 30p recording with 10-bit 4:2:2 provides exceptional resolution and grading flexibility. 4K 60p uses a slight crop (1.18x) but maintains outstanding quality with minimal aliasing. For slow motion, FHD 240fps opens creative possibilities without requiring external recorders. All video modes support F-Log2 for maximum dynamic range—approximately 13+ stops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heat management is exceptional for a compact mirrorless camera. Continuous 4K 60p recording is possible for 90+ minutes without overheating at normal temperatures. Even 6.2K 30p can record 60+ minutes before thermal limits are reached. The vari-angle touchscreen is invaluable for vlogging and low/high angle shots. Focus breathing is well-controlled, and the in-body stabilization provides smooth handheld footage—though a gimbal is still recommended for walking shots.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Ergonomics & Build</h3>
                <p>
                    The X-S20's compact form factor (127 x 85 x 65mm, 491g) makes it exceptionally portable without sacrificing usability. The deep grip provides secure handling even with larger lenses, and the button layout is intuitive with dedicated ISO, drive mode, and Q menu buttons. The 3.0" vari-angle touchscreen is responsive and works well for both navigation and touch-to-focus operation. The electronic viewfinder, while not class-leading at 2.36M dots, is bright and usable in most conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Build quality is solid with weather-resistant construction (splash/dust resistant), though not as robust as the X-T5 or X-H2S. The NP-W235 battery provides approximately 750 shots per charge (CIPA ECO mode)—significantly better than the X-S10's battery life. USB-C charging and power delivery enable all-day shooting with a power bank. The single SD card slot is a limitation for professionals who need backup redundancy, but acceptable for the target enthusiast market.

                            For 6.2K video, use UHS-II V90 SD cards (minimum 250MB/s write). Recommended: SanDisk Extreme Pro or Sony SF-G Tough. For 4K 60p, V60 cards work excellently.
