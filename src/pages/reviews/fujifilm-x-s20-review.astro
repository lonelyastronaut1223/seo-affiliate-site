                        detection AF, and Film Simulations—into a compact $1,299
                        body, Fujifilm has created the ultimate hybrid camera
                        for content creators and enthusiast photographers.

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Image Quality & X-Trans Magic</h3>
                <p>
                    The 26-megapixel X-Trans CMOS 5 HR sensor delivers
                    exceptional image quality with Fujifilm's signature color
                    science. Unlike Bayer sensors, the X-Trans color filter
                    array minimizes moiré and false colors without requiring an
                    optical low-pass filter, resulting in exceptional sharpness
                    and detail rendering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What truly sets the X-S20 apart is Fujifilm's Film
                    Simulations. With 19 modes including Velvia, Provia, Classic
                    Chrome, and the new Nostalgic Neg, you get stunning JPEG
                    files straight out of camera. Many photographers shoot
                    JPEG-only with Fujifilm, confident that color and tonality
                    will be exceptional. Dynamic range is
                    excellent—approximately 13 stops at base ISO, with excellent
                    shadow recovery in RAW files.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Autofocus Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    The X-S20 inherits the advanced AF system from the X-H2S,
                    including subject detection for animals, birds, cars,
                    motorcycles, bicycles, airplanes, and trains. In practice,
                    subject detection works remarkably well—bird Eye AF locks on
                    quickly and tracks erratic flight patterns with impressive
                    tenacity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Face and eye detection is reliable, working even when
                    subjects are small in frame or partially obscured. The
                    425-point phase-detection system covers most of the frame,
                    enabling flexible composition. While not quite as sticky as
                    Sony or Canon's latest systems in extremely challenging
                    conditions, it's more than adequate for 95% of shooting
                    situations and a dramatic improvement over previous Fujifilm
                    cameras.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Video Powerhouse</h3>
                <p>
                    Video is where the X-S20 truly shines. 6.2K 30p recording
                    with 10-bit 4:2:2 color internally provides exceptional
                    quality and grading flexibility. F-Log2 offers approximately
                    13 stops of dynamic range, enabling cinematic looks with
                    proper color grading. For most creators, 4K 60p is perfect
                    for smooth motion and occasional slow motion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The addition of FHD 240fps is a game-changer for creative
                    content— dramatic slow motion for b-roll, product shots, and
                    storytelling. Vlog mode simplifies settings for content
                    creators, with optimized exposure, simplified menus, and
                    product showcase mode for automatic focus transitions. Heat
                    management is excellent—continuous 4K 60p recording for 90+
                    minutes without overheating concerns.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Compact Build & Handling</h3>
                <p>
                    At just 491g with battery, the X-S20 is remarkably portable.
                    The grip, while smaller than flagship models, is comfortable
                    and provides secure handling even with larger lenses. The
                    vari-angle touchscreen is perfect for vlogging, high angles,
                    and ground-level shooting, though some photographers prefer
                    the X-T5's three-way tilt screen for quick vertical
                    orientation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Weather sealing provides confidence in light rain and dusty
                    conditions, though not as robust as the X-H2S or X-T5.
                    Battery life is exceptional— approximately 750 shots per
                    charge (CIPA), with real-world performance often exceeding
                    1,000 shots. USB-C charging enables all-day shooting with a
                    portable charger, perfect for travel and event coverage.

                            The X-S20 offers better video features (6.2K vs 6K,
                            Vlog mode), larger battery (750 vs 580 shots), and
                            costs $400 less. The X-T5 counters with higher
                            resolution (40MP vs 26MP), dual SD slots, and a
                            three-way tilting screen some prefer. For hybrid
                            shooters and content creators, the X-S20 is often
                            the better choice. For photography-focused users
                            needing maximum resolution, choose the X-T5.

                        <p>
                            Yes, surprisingly capable. The bird detection AF
                            works well, and paired with telephoto lenses like
                            the XF 70-300mm or 100-400mm, you can capture
                            excellent wildlife images. The APS-C sensor's 1.5x
                            crop factor actually helps with reach. However, the
                            8fps burst is slower than dedicated wildlife
                            cameras. It's very good for casual wildlife work but
                            not ideal for professional bird photography where
                            maximum speed is critical.

                        <p>
                            For 6.2K video, use UHS-II V90 SD cards (minimum
                            250MB/s write speed). Recommended brands: SanDisk
                            Extreme Pro, Sony SF-G Tough, or ProGrade Digital
                            V90. For 4K 60p and photography, V60 cards work
                            excellently. The dual SD slots allow simultaneous
                            backup or separating stills/video, though note
                            they're not CFexpress for absolute maximum speed.

                        <p>
                            No, heat management is excellent. Continuous 4K 60p
                            recording for 90+ minutes is possible without
                            overheating. Even 6.2K 30p can record for extended
                            periods (60+ minutes) at normal temperatures. The
                            camera includes temperature warnings well before
                            shutdown, giving you time to wrap up shots. For
                            professional video work, overheating is not a
                            practical concern with the X-S20.
