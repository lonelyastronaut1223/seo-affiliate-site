            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We exist to help creators, photographers, and videographers make informed camera buying decisions. In a
                world flooded with spec sheets and marketing hype, we focus on what actually matters: how cameras
                perform in your hands, in real shooting scenarios.</p>
            <p>Every review is based on extensive hands-on testing. We buy our own gear or rent it—no manufacturer has
                ever paid for placement or influenced our verdict.</p>

                <article class="card card-plain">
                    <h3>Real-World Scenarios</h3>
                    <p>We don't just shoot test charts. We take cameras on actual shoots: weddings, travel, street
                        photography, studio work, and outdoor adventures. If a camera overheats during a 30-minute
                        interview, you'll know about it.</p>

                    <h3>Autofocus Torture Tests</h3>
                    <p>We test AF tracking on moving subjects, in low light, with face/eye detection on, and in
                        challenging backlit conditions. We care about hit rate, not just manufacturer claims.</p>

                    <h3>Video Quality & Ergonomics</h3>
                    <p>Rolling shutter, overheating, codec quality, audio inputs, IBIS effectiveness—we test what
                        matters to hybrid shooters and vloggers, not just pixel peepers.</p>

                    <h3>Independence</h3>
                    <p>We purchase or rent all cameras ourselves. No manufacturer loans, no advance review units with
                        strings attached. If we recommend it, it's because we would buy it ourselves.</p>

                        regularly and update reviews when significant changes occur.</p>

            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>cameraupick is run by a small team of working photographers and videographers who have shot
                professionally for over a decade. We've covered weddings, corporate videos, YouTube content, and
                editorial assignments. We understand what gear actually matters because we use it to make a living.</p>
            <p>Our reviews reflect the perspective of full-time creators, not just tech enthusiasts. We care about
                battery life because we've run out of power during a paid shoot. We obsess over autofocus because we've
                missed critical moments. We test overheating because we've had cameras shut down mid-project.</p>
