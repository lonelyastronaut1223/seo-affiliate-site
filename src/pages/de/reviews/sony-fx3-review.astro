            The Sony FX3 is essentially a cinema camera shrunk to mirrorless size. It's officially Netflix-approved, shoots 4K120 internally, and has the legendary low-light sensor from the A7S III. This is the ultimate tool for professional filmmakers who need compact, high-performance video.

          <h2 class="product-title">Das Urteil</h2>
          <p>
            The Sony FX3 takes the A7S III's exceptional sensor and processor, strips away the photography features, and builds a cinema-focused body around it. The result is a compact powerhouse that Netflix officially approves for original content production—a rare honor for a sub-$4000 camera.
          </p>
          <p>
            At $3,898, it's expensive but delivers cinema-grade quality in a package that fits in a backpack. The included XLR handle, built-in cooling fan, and professional video features make this the ultimate tool for documentary filmmakers, commercial shooters, and indie cinema productions.

    <!-- IN-DEPTH PERFORMANCE -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">In-Depth Performance</h2>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Low-Light Performance</h3>
        <p>
          This is the FX3's superpower. The 12MP full-frame sensor has massive photosites that collect incredible amounts of light. ISO 25,600 looks cleaner than most cameras at ISO 6400. You can shoot in near darkness and get usable, gradable footage. For documentary work, concerts, or nighttime cityscapes, the FX3 is unmatched.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sensor is the same as the A7S III—Sony's legendary low-light champion. Extended ISO goes to 409,600, which is genuinely usable for extreme situations. Pair it with an f/1.4 lens, and you can film in conditions that would be impossible for any other camera.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>4K120 Slow Motion</h3>
        <p>
          Recording 4K at 120fps internally in 10-bit 4:2:2 is cinema-grade capability. The slow-motion footage is stunning—perfect for B-roll, action sequences, or emotional moments. There's a slight 1.1x crop at 4K120, but the quality is still exceptional. The rolling shutter is more visible than at lower frame rates but manageable with proper technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          For standard 4K24/30/60 work ,the full sensor width is used with oversampling from 4.2K. This delivers incredibly sharp, detailed footage with minimal aliasing or moiré. The 10-bit 4:2:2 codec gives massive grading latitude in post-production.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Professional Audio</h3>
        <p>
          The included XLR handle is a game-changer. You can connect professional microphones, wireless systems, or boom mics directly to the camera. 4-channel recording means you can capture two separate audio sources simultaneously (e.g., lavalier + shotgun mic). Phantom power is onboard, and audio levels can be controlled via physical dials.
        </p>
        <p>
          For quick shoots without external audio gear, the built-in stereo microphones are surprisingly good. They're better than most mirrorless cameras and handle wind noise well. But the XLR handle is where the FX3 truly shines for professional work.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Ergonomics & Cooling</h3>
        <p>
          The FX3's boxy cinema design is polarizing but functional. Multiple mounting points (no cage required) let you attach monitors, lights, and accessories directly. The built-in fan runs constantly, ensuring the camera never overheats—even during multi-hour 4K60 shoots in hot climates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vari-angle touchscreen is excellent for high/low angles. No viewfinder means you'll need an external monitor for bright daylight work. But the cinema-focused design makes sense: this camera is built for rigs, gimbals, and professional setups, not run-and-gun handheld.

            <p>
              Netflix maintains a list of cameras approved for their original content productions. The FX3 meets their technical requirements for 4K capture, dynamic range, color depth, and codec quality. It's a stamp of professional credibility that places the FX3 alongside cameras costing $10,000+.

              They share the same sensor and image quality. The FX3 adds XLR audio, cinema body design, Active Mode stabilization, and tally lights. The A7S III has an EVF and better ergonom ics for photography. If you shoot 90%+ video, get the FX3. If you need hybrid capability, get the A7S III.

          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Absolutely. 4K video only requires 8.3MP, so 12MP is plenty for oversampling. The lower resolution enables larger photosites, which dramatically improves low-light performance. This is a deliberate design choice prioritizing video quality over photo resolution.
