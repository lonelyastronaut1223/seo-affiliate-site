          <h2 class="product-title">Das Urteil</h2>
          <p>
            The A6700 brings flagship autofocus technology to APS-C. The AI processing unit (same chip as A7R V) can recognize animals, birds, insects, cars, trains, and airplanes—automatically tracking them with sticky precision. For wildlife and sports, this is game-changing.
          </p>
          <p>
            At $1,398 body-only, it's pricey for APS-C but delivers professional features: dual card slots, fully articulating screen, weather-sealing, and 4K120 oversampled from 6K. For YouTubers and hybrid shooters who need compact size with flagship performance, it's the sweet spot.

      <h2 class="section-title">Performance Breakdown</h2>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>AI Autofocus Technology</h3>
        <p>
          The A6700's autofocus is borrowed from Sony's flagship A7R V and A1. The dedicated AI processing unit analyzes the scene 60 times per second, recognizing subjects and predicting motion. For birds in flight, it tracks the eye even as the bird weaves through branches. For cars, it locks onto the driver's helmet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Real-time Eye AF works on humans and animals (dogs, cats, birds). The camera finds eyes automatically and sticks to them even in chaotic scenes. For wildlife, portraits, and sports, this is the most advanced AF system in any APS-C camera. It's legitimately pro-level.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
        <p>
          4K60 is oversampled from the full 6K sensor readout, delivering exceptional sharpness and detail. 10-bit 4:2:2 internal recording gives serious color grading flexibility. S-Log3 and S-Cinetone profiles match Sony's cinema line (FX3, FX6) for consistent color workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
          4K120 is a headline feature. It crops 1.58x (still usable) and delivers stunning slow-motion for B-roll. Active stabilization mode (digital+IBIS) provides gimbal-smooth handheld footage with a slight crop. For YouTube, commercials, and corporate video, the A6700 is a powerhouse.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Hybrid Performance</h3>
        <p>
          The 26MP sensor strikes a perfect balance: enough resolution for cropping and large prints, but not so many pixels that low-light suffers. ISO 6400 is clean; ISO 12,800 is usable. The 5.5-stop IBIS enables sharp handheld shots down to 1/4 second with stabilized lenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          11fps burst with full autofocus tracking is excellent for action. The buffer holds 1000+ JPEGs or 200+ RAW frames—you won't fill it in real-world shooting. For weddings, events, and sports, the A6700 delivers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Build & Usability</h3>
        <p>
          The fully articulating screen is a huge upgrade over previous A6xxx models (which had tilting screens). Vlogging, overhead shots, and low-angle video all benefit. The magnesium alloy body is weather-sealed against dust and moisture—you can shoot in rain or snow confidently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dual SD card slots provide backup security. The FZ100 battery lasts ~570 shots or 90 minutes of 4K recording. Menu system is Sony's latest (much improved over older models). Overall, it's a professional tool in a compact package.

            <p>
              If you want compact size and lighter lenses, the A6700 is brilliant. Full-frame (A7 IV, A7C II) gives better low-light and shallower depth-of-field, but costs more and weighs more. For travel, wildlife, and YouTube, APS-C is often ideal. The A6700 has flagship features at 60% the cost.

          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Yes! All Sony FE lenses work on the A6700 (with 1.5x crop factor). This is great for lens investment—if you upgrade to full-frame later, your lenses carry over. Native APS-C lenses are smaller/lighter, but FE lenses give more options.

          <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
            <p>
              Sony includes active cooling (fan-like ventilation) to prevent overheating. In normal conditions, you get unlimited 4K60 recording. In extreme heat (35°C+), you might hit limits after 60+ minutes. For most users, it's a non-issue. Vastly improved over older Sony cameras.

        <h2>Abschließende Empfehlung</h2>
        <p>
          The Sony A6700 is the best APS-C hybrid camera in 2026. The AI-powered autofocus rivals flagship full-frame cameras, 4K120 video opens creative possibilities, and the compact build makes it perfect for travel and everyday shooting. It's expensive for APS-C, but the feature set justifies the price.

          <strong>Kaufe sie, wenn:</strong> You want flagship autofocus and video in a compact body, shoot wildlife or sports, create YouTube content, or value portability over full-frame advantages.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Überspringe sie, wenn:</strong> You need the absolute best low-light (get A7 IV or A7C II), are on a budget (get Sony ZV-E10 II or Canon R50), or only shoot photos (Fujifilm X-T5 offers more value).
