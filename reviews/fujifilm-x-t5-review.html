            <h2 class="product-title">The Verdict</h2>
            <p>
              The Fujifilm X-T5 is a love letter to photographers. It ditches the "hybrid" flip screen of the X-T4 for a
              photographer-friendly 3-way tilt screen and packs a massive <strong>40MP sensor</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              With dedicated dials for shutter speed, ISO, and exposure compensation, it's a joy to use. While the
              autofocus isn't quite at Sony's level for sports, the <strong>Film Simulations</strong> make your JPEGs
              look like finished art straight out of camera.
            </p>

          <h3>Image Quality</h3>
          <p>The 40MP sensor resolves an incredible amount of detail, allowing for significant cropping. Fuji's color
            science remains unmatched—skin tones are natural, and the film simulations (Classic Chrome, Nostalgic Neg)
            save hours of editing.</p>

          <h3>Handling & Build</h3>
          <p>It's smaller and lighter than the X-T4 but feels just as dense and premium. The return of the 3-way tilt
            screen is a huge win for street and landscape photographers who hate flipping out a screen to the side.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="card card-plain">
          <h3>Video Performance</h3>
          <p>While photo-first, it shoots beautiful 6.2K video. Just be aware of the rolling shutter in the highest
            quality modes. For casual clips or interviews, it's more than capable, but it's not a run-and-gun video
            workhorse.</p>
