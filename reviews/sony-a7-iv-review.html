            <h2 class="product-title">The Verdict</h2>
            <p>
              The Sony A7 IV remains the benchmark for "do-it-all" cameras. While newer models like the A7 V offer
              marginal gains, the Mark IV hits the sweet spot of <strong>33MP resolution</strong> and reliable
              <strong>10-bit 4K video</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Its autofocus is practically cheating—it locks onto eyes/faces instantly so you never miss a shot. The
              only real downside is the rolling shutter in 4K full-frame mode, but for 90% of creators, this is the
              perfect tool.
            </p>

          <h3>Autofocus</h3>
          <p>Sony’s Real-time Tracking is simply the best. Whether it's a bride walking down the aisle or a dog running
            in the park, the green box sticks like glue. It has dedicated modes for Humans, Animals, and Birds.</p>

          <h3>Video Capabilities</h3>
          <p>The 7K oversampled 4K30 is stunningly sharp. While the 4K60 crop is annoying for wide shots, it effectively
            turns your 24-70mm lens into a 36-105mm, giving you extra reach for B-roll.</p>

        <article class="card card-plain">
          <h3>Ergonomics</h3>
          <p>Since the A7 III, the grip is deeper and more comfortable. The new menu system is touch-responsive and
            finally organized logically, unlike older Sony cameras.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is the Sony A7 IV worth it in 2026?</h3>
          <p>Yes, the Sony A7 IV remains one of the best hybrid cameras in 2026. Its combination of 33MP resolution,
            excellent autofocus, 4K60 video, and mature lens ecosystem make it a top choice for creators who need both
            photo and video capabilities. While newer cameras exist, the A7 IV offers exceptional value at $2,498.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What are the main disadvantages of the Sony A7 IV?</h3>
          <p>The main cons are: rolling shutter in 4K60 mode, 1.5x crop in 4K60 (unlike the R6 II which has no crop),
            menu complexity for beginners, and the price point of $2,498 which may be steep for hobbyists. Additionally,
            some users find the grip could be more substantial.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Sony A7 IV vs Canon R6 II: Which is better?</h3>
          <p>Sony A7 IV offers higher resolution (33MP vs 24MP) and better value for photography, while Canon R6 II has
            superior video AF and no crop in 4K60. Choose Sony if photography is your priority and you value resolution.
            Choose Canon if video is your main focus and you need uncropped 4K60.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is the Sony A7 IV good for beginners?</h3>
          <p>The Sony A7 IV is powerful but may be overwhelming for absolute beginners due to its complex menu system
            and advanced features. If you're new to cameras, consider starting with the Sony A7C II or ZV-E10, then
            upgrade later. However, if you're serious about learning and have the budget, the A7 IV will serve you well
            for years.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What lenses work best with the Sony A7 IV?</h3>
          <p>The Sony A7 IV works with all Sony E-mount lenses. Popular choices include: Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 GM II
            (versatile zoom), Sony 35mm f/1.8 (compact prime), Sony 85mm f/1.8 (portraits), and Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8
            (budget-friendly option). The mature lens ecosystem is one of Sony's biggest advantages.</p>
